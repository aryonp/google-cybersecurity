This repo holds all of the projects, notes, and write-ups I have done while completing the [Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate](https://grow.google/certificates/cybersecurity/#?modal_active=none).

In this course I gained foundational knowledge that will prepare me for entry-level jobs in cybersecurity and help me understand how security teams protect their organizations and its customers.
