00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.300
Hello and welcome to

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.615
the Google Career Certificate
focused on cybersecurity.

3
00:00:06.615 --> 00:00:08.715
I'm so excited that you're here!

4
00:00:08.715 --> 00:00:10.380
My name is Toni, and I am

5
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.230
a Security Engineering
Manager at Google.

6
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.150
I'll be your instructor for

7
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.895
the first course of this
certificate program.

8
00:00:17.895 --> 00:00:19.650
By starting this course,

9
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.050
you've already taken
a big step towards

10
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.140
building new skills that will
help you in your career.

11
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.470
Cybersecurity may seem
daunting at first,

12
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.030
but you'd be surprised by

13
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.325
the different backgrounds
many of us have.

14
00:00:32.325 --> 00:00:34.890
I worked as an intelligence
analyst before I

15
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.200
got my first job in
the security industry,

16
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.760
and I'm excited to be

17
00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.255
your instructor as you begin
your journey into security.

18
00:00:43.255 --> 00:00:44.345
The demand for
security professionals

19
00:00:44.345 --> 00:00:46.565
is growing at an
incredible rate.

20
00:00:46.565 --> 00:00:50.510
By 2030, the U.S. Bureau
of Labor Statistics

21
00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.320
expects security roles to
grow by more than 30%,

22
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.640
which is higher than

23
00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.310
the average growth rate
for other occupations.

24
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.370
Global access to the
internet is expanding.

25
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.485
Every day, more people and

26
00:01:03.485 --> 00:01:07.090
organizations are adopting
new digital technologies.

27
00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.230
Having a diverse community of

28
00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.629
security professionals
with unique backgrounds,

29
00:01:11.629 --> 00:01:14.480
perspectives, and experiences is

30
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.735
essential for protecting and
serving different markets.

31
00:01:18.735 --> 00:01:20.240
Working in security
has allowed me to

32
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.925
work with people from
all around the world.

33
00:01:22.925 --> 00:01:24.590
Working with people who have

34
00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.560
diverse backgrounds
ensures that our teams get

35
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.255
to ask lots of questions

36
00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:32.180
and come up with more
creative solutions.

37
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.670
The main objective
in security is to

38
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.430
protect organizations
and people.

39
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.530
This line of work allows you to

40
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.000
support and interact with
people across the globe.

41
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.750
There are many openings for

42
00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.805
entry-level security analysts,

43
00:01:46.805 --> 00:01:48.830
and employers are
struggling to find

44
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:51.425
enough candidates with
the right expertise.

45
00:01:51.425 --> 00:01:55.100
This program is designed to
give you the knowledge and

46
00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.855
skills you need to start

47
00:01:56.855 --> 00:01:59.090
or advance in the
security profession.

48
00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.235
No matter your
current skill level,

49
00:02:01.235 --> 00:02:03.905
by the time you finish
this certificate program,

50
00:02:03.905 --> 00:02:05.495
you'll be prepared to find

51
00:02:05.495 --> 00:02:09.680
a security-related job or
expand your career in security.

52
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.510
You may be wondering,

53
00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.125
what do security
professionals actually do?

54
00:02:15.125 --> 00:02:17.660
Have you ever had to
update your password

55
00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.275
online to include a number
or a special symbol?

56
00:02:21.275 --> 00:02:24.110
If so, then you're
already familiar with

57
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.265
basic security measures,
like password management.

58
00:02:27.265 --> 00:02:31.010
And if you've ever received
a notification from

59
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.315
a service provider about
stolen data or a software hack,

60
00:02:35.315 --> 00:02:37.399
then you have
first-hand experience

61
00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:39.875
with the impact of
a security breach.

62
00:02:39.875 --> 00:02:41.840
If you've ever asked yourself

63
00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.435
how organizations
safeguard data,

64
00:02:44.435 --> 00:02:45.920
then you already have

65
00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.230
two important traits
that are necessary

66
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.475
to thrive in this industry:
curiosity and excitement.

67
00:02:53.475 --> 00:02:55.280
Security analysts help minimize

68
00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.280
risks to organizations
and people.

69
00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.820
Analysts work to proactively
guard against incidents

70
00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.055
while continuously monitoring
systems and networks.

71
00:03:06.055 --> 00:03:08.420
And, if an incident does occur,

72
00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.284
they investigate and
report their findings.

73
00:03:11.284 --> 00:03:13.040
They are always asking

74
00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.870
questions and looking
for solutions.

75
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.495
One of the best things
about the security industry

76
00:03:19.495 --> 00:03:23.200
is the many paths and career
options it exposes you to.

77
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.330
Each option involves
a unique set

78
00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.565
of skills and responsibilities.

79
00:03:27.565 --> 00:03:29.680
No matter what your
background is,

80
00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.270
you'll probably find that you

81
00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.835
already have some
relevant experience.

82
00:03:33.835 --> 00:03:37.525
If you enjoy collaborating
with and helping others,

83
00:03:37.525 --> 00:03:40.645
solving puzzles, and are
motivated by challenges,

84
00:03:40.645 --> 00:03:42.860
then this is the career for you.

85
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.430
For example, my background as

86
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.750
an intelligence analyst had

87
00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.105
nothing to do with
cybersecurity.

88
00:03:49.105 --> 00:03:50.440
However, having

89
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.605
strong critical thinking skills
and communication skills

90
00:03:53.605 --> 00:03:55.480
provided a solid foundation for

91
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.520
my success when I decided to
pursue a career in security.

92
00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.300
If you're not sure what
direction you want to

93
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.165
take in the security
industry, that's okay.

94
00:04:05.165 --> 00:04:07.550
This program will give
you an overview of

95
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:10.190
many different types
of available jobs.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.020
It will also let you explore

97
00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:14.090
certain specialized
skill sets to help

98
00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.700
you figure out where you
want to take your career.

99
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.520
